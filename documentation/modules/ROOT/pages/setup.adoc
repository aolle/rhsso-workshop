== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift

Red Hat Single Sign-On (aka RH-SSO) can be deployed using the Operator or the application template.

The Operator automates and simplifies the administration tasks in OpenShift using the custom resources (CRs). It means that we can create RH-SSO resources using these custom resources instead of using the RH-SSO admin console.

IMPORTANT: The Operator performs a one-way synchronization of the CRs. If we modify a CR directly (for example, using `oc`) the changes show up in the RH-SSO admin console; however, if the same resource is modified using the admin console, those changes have no effect on the CR.

WARNING: If the RH-SSO fails during deployment, check if a `LimitRange` exists in the current `OCP` project. Sometimes, the `RHPDS` environment creates a `LimitRange` automatically when a new project is created. Check also the health checks probes, the initial delay may require a higher value.

NOTE: For this workshop, we will assume that RH-SSO has been installed using the templates and imagestream method explained in xref:setup.adoc#deployrhsso-templates[1.2.2 Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift using the templates].
Additionally, for convenience and simplification purposes, the applications and services will be deployed in the same project where RH-SSO is deployed.

=== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift using the Operator

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to subscribe and deploy the `Red Hat Single Sign-on Operator`. The RH-SSO Operator simplifies the deployment process and its ease to use, but less flexible than the template based deployment.

Check the supported CR here:

https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-operator#supported-custom-resources

* Open a browser window and log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators` → `OperatorHub`.

* In the Filter by keyword field, type `rhsso`.

* Select the Red Hat Quay tile and click `Install`.

image::install/install-sso-operator.png[]

* On the Install Operator page leave `stable` from the list of available Update Channel options. The Operator supports only the `A specific namespace on the cluster` as installation mode. Create the `sso` project. Choose `Automatic` update approval.

* Click `Install`.

Installing RH-SSO using a custom resource:

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators` → `Installed Operators`. Project: `sso`. Select Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator.

* Click `Create instance` of the Keycloak tile.

* Change the Name if desired. Click `Create`.

[#deployrhsso-templates]
=== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift using the templates

* Create the templates and install the RH-SSO image stream.

NOTE: For this workshop, we will use the `sso76-ocp4-x509-https` template; which is Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 on OpenJDK (Ephemeral), with re-encrypt TLS termination. The template does not require the manual creation of the keystores or truststores.
