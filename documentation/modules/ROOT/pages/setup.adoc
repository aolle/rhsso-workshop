== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift

Red Hat Single Sign-On can be deployed using either the Operator or the application template.

The Operator automates and simplifies the administration tasks in Red Hat OpenShift using custom resources (CRs). It means that we can create Red Hat Single Sign-On resources using these custom resources instead of using the Red Hat Single Sign-On admin console.

IMPORTANT: The Operator performs a one-way synchronization of the CRs. If we modify a CR directly (for example, using `oc`) the changes show up in the Red Hat Single Sign-On admin console. However, if the same resource is modified using the admin console, those changes have no effect on the CR.

WARNING: If the Red Hat Single Sign-On fails during deployment, check if a `LimitRange` exists in the current Red Hat OpenShift project. Sometimes, the `RHPDS` environment automatically creates a `LimitRange` when a new project is created. Also, check the health check probes. The initial delay may require a higher value.

NOTE: For this workshop, we assume that Red Hat Single Sign-On has been installed using the templates and imagestream method explained in xref:setup.adoc#deployrhsso-templates[1.2.2 Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for Red Hat OpenShift using the templates].
Additionally, for convenience and simplification purposes, we will depoy applications and services in the same project where Red Hat Single Sign-On is deployed.

[#deployrhsso-operator]
=== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift using the Operator

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to subscribe and deploy the `Red Hat Single Sign-on Operator`. The Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator simplifies the deployment process and it is ease to use, but less flexible than the template-based deployment.

Check the supported CRs here:

https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-operator#supported-custom-resources

* Open a browser window and log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators`, then `OperatorHub`.

* In the Filter by keyword field, type `rhsso`.

image::install/operatorhub-sso.png[]

* Select the Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator tile and click `Install`.

image::install/install-sso-operator.png[]

* On the Install Operator page, leave `stable` from the list of available `Update Channel` options. The Operator supports only the `A specific namespace on the cluster` as installation mode. Create the `sso` project. Choose `Automatic` update approval.

image::install/sso-operator-opts.png[]

* Click `Install`.

Installing Red Hat Single Sign-On using a custom resource:

* From the Administrator perspective, click on `Operators`, then select `Installed Operators`. Make sure to select `sso` project. Select Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator.

* Click `Create instance` of the Keycloak tile.

image::install/keycloak-tile.png[]

* Change the `Name` if desired. Then, click `Create`.

[#deployrhsso-templates]
=== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift using the templates

* Create the templates and install the Red Hat Single Sign-On image stream.

// https://github.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/pull/268

NOTE: For this workshop, we will use the `sso76-ocp4-x509-postgresql-persistent` template, which is Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 on OpenJDK + PostgreSQL (Persistent) for Red Hat OpenShift 4.X. The template does not require the manual creation of the keystores or truststores.

[#deploy-ipa]
== 1.3 Deploying an Identity Management (IdM/FreeIPA) on Red Hat OpenShift

This section explains how to install FreeIPA, an Identity Management (IdM) solution that combines Linux, 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, NTP, DNS and Dogtag.

https://www.freeipa.org/page/About

FreeIPA is the upstream version of Red Hat Identity Management.

Later on, we will see how we can integrate Red Hat Single Sign-On with IdM/FreeIPA.

To get started, stay logged in into your Red Hat OpenShift platform, and for convenience, select the `sso` project that has been created previously. Follow the steps below for deploying a FreeIPA instance on top of Red Hat OpenShift.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# export the image that we are going to deploy
export IMG=quay.io/freeipa/freeipa-openshift-container:latest
export IMG_BASE=${IMG}

# clone the repository and deploy the roles and scc
# if preferred, a remote build could be performed instead of cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-openshift-container.git
cd freeipa-openshift-container/
kustomize build deploy/admin | oc create -f -

# create the ocp template and deploy it
make template-create
make template-new-app
----

Write down the `IPA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `IPA_DM_PASSWORD` displayed on the terminal; we will need it later.

Open the FreeIPA administration console to verify that the access and credentials are working properly.
