[#deployrhsso]
== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift

Red Hat Single Sign-On (aka RH-SSO) can be deployed using the Operator or the application template.

The Operator automates and simplifies the administration tasks in OpenShift using the custom resources (CRs). It means that we can create RH-SSO resources using these custom resources instead of using the RH-SSO admin console.

IMPORTANT: The Operator performs a one-way synchronization of the CRs. If we modify a CR directly (for example, using `oc`) the changes show up in the RH-SSO admin console; however, if the same resource is modified using the admin console, those changes have no effect on the CR.

WARNING: If the RH-SSO fails during deployment, check if a `LimitRange` exists in the current `OCP` project. Sometimes, the `RHPDS` environment creates a `LimitRange` automatically when a new project is created. Check also the health checks probes, the initial delay may require a higher value.

NOTE: For this workshop, we will assume that RH-SSO has been installed using the templates and imagestream method explained in xref:setup.adoc#deployrhsso-templates[1.2.2 Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift using the templates].
Additionally, for convenience and simplification purposes, the applications and services will be deployed in the same project where RH-SSO is deployed.

=== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift using the Operator

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to subscribe and deploy the `Red Hat Single Sign-on Operator`. The RH-SSO Operator simplifies the deployment process and its ease to use, but less flexible than the template based deployment.

Check the supported CRs here:

https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-operator#supported-custom-resources

* Open a browser window and log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators` → `OperatorHub`.

* In the Filter by keyword field, type `rhsso`.

image::install/operatorhub-sso.png[]

* Select the Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator tile and click `Install`.

image::install/install-sso-operator.png[]

* On the Install Operator page leave `stable` from the list of available Update Channel options. The Operator supports only the `A specific namespace on the cluster` as installation mode. Create the `sso` project. Choose `Automatic` update approval.

image::install/sso-operator-opts.png[]

* Click `Install`.

Installing RH-SSO using a custom resource:

* From the Administrator perspective, click `Operators` → `Installed Operators`. Project: `sso`. Select Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator.

* Click `Create instance` of the Keycloak tile.

image::install/keycloak-tile.png[]

* Change the Name if desired. Click `Create`.

[#deployrhsso-templates]
=== Deploying Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift using the templates

* Create the templates and install the RH-SSO image stream.

// https://github.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/pull/268

NOTE: For this workshop, we will use the `sso76-ocp4-x509-postgresql-persistent` template; which is Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 on OpenJDK + PostgreSQL (Persistent) for OpenShift 4.X. The template does not require the manual creation of the keystores or truststores.

[#deploy-ipa]
== 1.3 Deploying an Identity Management (IdM/FreeIPA) on OpenShift

This section explains how to install FreeIPA, an Identity Management (IdM) that combines Linux, 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, NTP, DNS and Dogtag.

https://www.freeipa.org/page/About

FreeIPA is the upstream version of Red Hat Identity Management.

Later, we will see how we can integrate RH-SSO with IdM/FreeIPA.

Staying logged in into your OCP platform, and for convenience, select the `sso` project that has been created previously. Follow those steps for deploying a FreeIPA instance on top of OpenShift.

# export the image that we are going to deploy
export IMG=quay.io/freeipa/freeipa-openshift-container:latest
export IMG_BASE=${IMG}

# clone the repository and deploy the roles and scc
# if preferred, a remote build could be performed instead of cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-openshift-container.git
cd freeipa-openshift-container/
kustomize build deploy/admin | oc create -f -

# create the ocp template and deploy it
make template-create
make template-new-app
----

Write down the `IPA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `IPA_DM_PASSWORD` shown on the terminal, we will need it later.

Open the FreeIPA administration console, check the access and credentials are working properly.
