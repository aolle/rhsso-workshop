== Vault SPI

The Vault SPI enables the creation of custom extensions for Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) that integrate with any external vault implementation.

Using the Vault SPI, RH-SSO can securely retrieve secrets—such as passwords, keys, or tokens—from the vault of your choice, providing a flexible and centralized way to manage sensitive data.
