= JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
include::_attributes.adoc[]

JWT stands for "JSON Web Token," which is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It's often used for authentication and authorization in web applications, APIs, and microservices.

JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing the token. The payload contains the actual data being transmitted, such as user information or permissions. The signature is used to verify that the token was not tampered with during transmission.

JWTs are commonly used in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows, where they are used to securely transmit information about the user and their authorization status between the client and the authorization server.

One of the key advantages of JWTs is that they are stateless, meaning that the server doesn't need to maintain a session or store the token. This makes JWTs ideal for use in microservices and distributed systems.

In terms of security, JWTs are generally considered to be secure as long as the signature is properly implemented and verified. The signature is generated using a secret key that is known only to the issuing server, and is used to verify that the token has not been tampered with during transmission.

Note that while this section on JWTs could be included in the context of the section 2.1.2, I decided to create a separate section to specifically address the topic. However, it's important to note that the scenarios we're starting from are those of a web application that has already been secured using OpenID Connect (OIDC).
