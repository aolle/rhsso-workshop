= JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
include::_attributes.adoc[]

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are widely used for authentication and authorization in web applications, APIs, and microservices.

A JWT consists of three parts: a *header*, a *payload*, and a *signature*.
The header typically specifies the token type and the signing algorithm. The payload contains the claims - information such as user identity, permissions, or other metadata. The signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the token, verifying that it has not been altered during transmission.

JWTs are a key component in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows, where they securely convey user identity and authorization data between the client and the authorization server.

One of the main advantages of JWTs is that they are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to store session data. This property makes them ideal for microservices and distributed environments.

From a security perspective, JWTs are considered secure when the signature is properly implemented and verified. The signing key - known only to the issuing server - ensures that tokens cannot be tampered with or forged.
