We have an external system that stores and manage users, the data is available through a REST API.

Due some constraints, we don't want to migrate that existing system to Red Hat Single Sign-On data model, because of that, we are interested in expanding and integrate our Red Hat Single Sign-On deployment with this external user storage system.

The REST API has been coded in Quarkus, the project name is `jaxrs-user-store` and it provides the following two endpoints:

* `/api/v1/users`, returns a set of all the users in the system.

* `/api/v1/users/{id}`, returns the user that `userId` matches with `id`.

Both endpoints expects a `GET` request.

The application is prepared to be deployed on top of OpenShift. Deploy it by executing the `ocp-deploy.sh` script or alternatively:

./mvnw install -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true

For extending Red Hat Single Sign-On to connect it to the external system we use the `User Storage SPI` (`Service Provider Interface`).

The provider implementation is `custom-user-storage-spi` and can be deployed in some different ways:

* Extending the Red Hat Single Sign-On image.
* Mounting a volume with the file.
* Using a configmap (not recommended, as the configmap has a limited size and should be used for storing metadata mainly).
* Copying it into the pod (ephemeral).
* Others.

The provider checks the value of the `USER_STORAGE_CUSTOM_SPI_TARGET_HOST` environment variable in the following format: `HOST:PORT` or `HOST` if the port defaults to http/80. The value can be provided as an environment variable in the `DeploymentConfig`.

Once the environment variable and the package is correctly deployed, we will see the new provider listed under the `User Federation` of the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration web console.

* Click `demo-user-provider`.

* Verify that it is `Enabled` and `Save`.

* Click `Users`. The external storage users should be loaded into Red Hat Single Sign-On.
