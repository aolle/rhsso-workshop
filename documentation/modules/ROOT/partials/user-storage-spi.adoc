We have an external system that stores and manages user data which is accessible via a REST API.

However, due to certain constraints, we do not want to migrate this existing system to Red Hat Single Sign-On data model. Therefore, we are interested in expanding and integrate our Red Hat Single Sign-On deployment with this external user storage system.

The REST API has been developed using Quarkus and is named `jaxrs-user-store`. It provides two endpoints:

* `/api/v1/users`, which returns a set of all the users in the system.

* `/api/v1/users/{id}`, which returns the user that matches the `userId` with `id`.

Both endpoints accept `GET` requests.

The application is designed to be deployed on top of OpenShift. You can deploy it by running the `ocp-deploy.sh` script or alternatively:

For extending Red Hat Single Sign-On to connect to the external system, we use the `User Storage SPI` (`Service Provider Interface`).

The provider implementation is `custom-user-storage-spi` and can be deployed in several ways:

* By extending the Red Hat Single Sign-On image.
* By mounting a volume with the file.
* By using a configmap (although this is not recommended as the configmap has a limited size and should be used mainly for storing metadata).
* By copying it into the pod (which is ephemeral).
* And others ways as well.

The provider checks the value of the `USER_STORAGE_CUSTOM_SPI_TARGET_HOST` environment variable in the following format: `HOST:PORT` or `HOST` if the port defaults to `http/80`. The value can be provided as an environment variable in the `DeploymentConfig`.

Once the environment variable and the package are correctly deployed, we will see the new provider listed under the `User Federation` section of the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration web console.

* Click `demo-user-provider`.

* Verify that it is `Enabled` and click `Save`.

* Click `Users`. The external storage users should now be loaded into Red Hat Single Sign-On.
