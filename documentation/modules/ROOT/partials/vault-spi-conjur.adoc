This chapter explains how to integrate Red Hat Single Sign-On with Conjur using the Vault SPI. For the demo, we will obtain the 389 Directory Server credentials of the `cn=Directory Manager` user stored in Conjur that has to be used by Red Hat Single Sign-On for the user federation.

Setup steps:

* Run the provided Conjur OSS community collection provided with this workshop.

* Create the admin account `demoAccount`.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
conjurctl account create demoAccount > /tmp/admin_data
----

The `admin_data` file contains the public key and the API key of the admin user on that account.

* Load the provided Conjur policy and create a secret for the demo by running the following commands in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
APIKEY=$(sed -n '/API/ s/.*: *//p' /tmp/admin_data)

TOKEN=$(curl --header "Accept-Encoding: base64" -d $APIKEY https://$CONJUR_HOST/authn/demoAccount/admin/authenticate)

curl -H "Authorization: Token token=\"${TOKEN}\"" -d "$(< policy.yml)" https://$CONJUR_HOST/policies/demoAccount/policy/root

curl -H "Authorization: Token token=\"${TOKEN}\"" -d "password" https://$CONJUR_HOST/secrets/demoAccount/variable/ldap/password
----

NOTE: we are using the REST API, but other approaches like Conjur CLI (or others) can also be used.

* Export the required environment variables.

NOTE: instead of exporting the Conjur API required configuration as environment variables, it can also be configured with SPI provider properties.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
export CONJUR_ACCOUNT=demoAccount
export CONJUR_AUTHN_API_KEY=$APIKEY
export CONJUR_APPLIANCE_URL=https://$CONJUR_HOST
export CONJUR_AUTHN_LOGIN=admin
----

* Deploy the extension and configure the SPI.

[.lines_space]

----
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault:add
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault/provider=conjur-vault:add(enabled=true)
/subsystem=keycloak-server/spi=vault:write-attribute(name=default-provider,value=conjur-vault)
:reload
----

Ensure that the 389 Directory Server is up and running and that you have deployed the Conjur extension and configured the Vault SPI as described in the previous steps.

* Open a browser window and log in to the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration web console.

* Select the `Demo` realm.

* Click `User Federation`.

* Select `ldap` as the provider.

* Fill in the user federation provider settings with the appropiate values for your LDAP server. Click the `Test connection` button to check the connection. If successful, you should see a message saying "Success! LDAP connection successful".

* Test the authentication with a random wrong password. It should fail.

* Enter the field as the vault value, `${vault.ldap/password}` for the `Bind Credential` field. Test the authentication again. It should now work.
