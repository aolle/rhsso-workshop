Once we have secured the application using OIDC (see section `2.1.2 - Securing Quarkus web applications using OpenID Connect (OIDC)`), we may have a need to add a custom claim to the JWT token based on a user attribute, in order to use that attribute for authorization.

In this section, we will see how Red Hat Single Sign-On allows us to map user attributes to claims.

* Open a web browser and log in to the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console. Navigate to `Clients` and select the `quarkus-petclinic` client from our `Demo` realm. Then, click on the `Mappers` tab and select the `Create` button.

* Fill out the information for the attribute that we want to map to a claim. Under the `Mapper Type` option, select `User attribute`. Then, select the data type for the JSON claim.

For our example, we will map the `admin` attribute, which is a `boolean`. Once we have completed these steps, click on the `Save` button.

* After creating the mapper, we need to add the attribute to our test user. Navigate to `Users` and click on View all users. Select the previously created user, angel, to edit.

* Go to the `Attributes` tab, fill in the fields and click `Add`. Then, click on `Save`.

We should now have the new claim present in the JWT. In my case, I will verify this by inspecting its value from the Quarkus petclinic application. I will use CDI to inject the `JsonWebToken` and then inspect it. Of course, any other valid procedure could be used.

After logging in to the application with an authorized user, we can check the JWT.

If we decode the JWT, we can see that the new attribute has been added.
